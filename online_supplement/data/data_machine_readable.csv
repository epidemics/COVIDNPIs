Moreover, on March 21 a curfew was introduced for the entire Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina every day from 18:00 until 05:00, and its implementation started on 22 March 2020.

However, given limited hours of the curfew; the fact that the movement restriction only applied to people under 18 or over 65 (roughly 32% of the population); and that the Federation of the BiH accounts for roughly 65% of the population of Bosnia and Herzegovina, we decided that this did not amount to a stay-at-home order by our definitions.

Secondary schools (collèges), which had so far only been able to reopen in green zones, would begin to reopen as of June 2nd, “both in green and orange zones,” Blanquer said.
