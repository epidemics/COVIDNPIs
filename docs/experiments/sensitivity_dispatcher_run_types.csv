Run Type,Description,Experiment File
region_holdout,Mask data for one region and output prediction for the masked region. Runs once for each region.,region_holdout.py

npi_prior,"Run the model with an NPI effetiveness prior of [skewed 10, Normal(0,0.2), ICL]",alternative_build_param.py
agg_holdout,Mask the final 20 days of data and predict this period with the model,agg_holdout.py
any_npi_active,Add an additional dummy NPI representing whether any major NPI is active,any_npi_active.py
delay_schools,Run the model with an additional 5 day delay to school and university closures,delay_schools.py
