### Generating GLEAM scenarios
# All combinations of groups and traces are created.
#
# Group and trace `name` values must contain all the classes in the
# parameters configuration sheet of that type. Groups and traces listed
# here that have no configuration will still be computed, but only with
# the parameters common to all classes of that type.
scenarios:
  # This will be the simulation name prefix in GLEAMviz. The full name
  # of each simulation will be "{name} ({group.name} + {trace.name})"
  name: "Main Web"

  # These are the different tabs you can click on to see different
  # charts.
  groups:
    - name: Scenario 1
      description: Current mitigation measures are completely lifted without replacement.
    - name: Scenario 2
      description: Current mitigation measures are replaced by milder measures afterwards.
    - name: Scenario 3
      description: Current mitigation measures are replaced by strong mitigation afterwards.
    - name: Scenario 4
      description: Current mitigation measures are replaced by moderate mitigation afterwards.

  # These show up as individual lines on each chart.
  traces:
    - name: HIGHER_WEAK
      description: Faster spread (110%)<br>Less air travel
    - name: EXPECTED_WEAK

    - name: LOWER_WEAK
      description: Slower spread (90%)<br>Less air travel
    - name: HIGHER_STRONG
      description: Faster spread (110%)<br>Much less air travel
    - name: EXPECTED_STRONG
      description: Expected spread (100%)<br>Much less air travel
    - name: LOWER_STRONG
