Sensitivity experiments vary different features of the input data, model structure or assumptions and allow us to see how sensitive the results are to these features. The sensitivity dispatcher is a utility for running multiple pre-defined experiments from the command line. In addition, individual experiments can be run which allows for some more control over experiment parameters.
